## Background
Enzymatic reaction networks are crucial to better understand the mechanistic function of metabolites and proteins, with their specificity determined by metabolite-enzyme interac-tions. The increasing number of metabolic reactions cataloged in metabolic databases allows the development of computational methods to predict enzymatic reaction networks efficient-ly, which will alleviate time-consuming and labor-intensive experimental approaches.
## Results
In this study, we propose the MPI-VGAE framework to predict metabolite-protein interac-tions (MPI) in a heterogeneous network. The genome-scale heterogeneous enzymatic reac-tion network consists of proteins and metabolites across ten organisms, as constructed based on the enzymatic reactions from Pathbank. We optimized the Variational Graph Au-toencoders (VGAE) model to incorporate both molecular features of metabolites and pro-teins as well as neighboring features to achieve the best predictive performance of MPI. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to learn and transform the binary mo-lecular fingerprints of metabolites to continuous variables, which enhanced the MPI predic-tion accuracy. Sequence-based protein features were generated by a protein-embedding model, which offers rapid and computation-efficient performance. The MPI-VGAE framework showed stable performance in the reconstruction of hundreds of metabolic pathways and five functional enzymatic reaction networks. The MPI-VGAE framework was also applied to a homogenous metabolic reaction network and achieved as high per-formance as other state-of-art methods. These results highlight the potential of the MPI-VGAE framework for the discovery of novel enzymatic reactions.
