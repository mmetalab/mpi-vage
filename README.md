# Machine Learning Methods on Detecting Fraudulent Click Traffic for Mobile App Ads
  Fraud risk is everywhere, but for companies that advertise online, click fraud can happen at an overwhelming volume, resulting in misleading click data and wasted money. Ad channels can drive up costs by simply clicking on the ad at a large scale. In TalkingData, the current approach to prevent click fraud for app developers is to measure the journey of a userâ€™s click across their portfolio, and flag IP addresses who produce lots of clicks, but never end up installing apps. In this project, we develop the solution one step further by building an efficient machine learning algorithm that predicts whether a user will download an app after clicking a mobile app ad.<br>
  In this project, we applied random over sampling technique to deal with imbalanced data, implemented and tuned multiple ML algorithms and ensemble learning models. It shows that ensemble learning model with Decision Tree Classifier of bagging algorithm performs best among all the ML models. <br>
  All the details and codes are included in the Jupyter Notebook.
